		<h1>About Dom Cavarsan</h1>
		<p> Gday there so as you already know my name is Dominic Cavarsan and right at this moment you are looking at my website, good stuff! Im the guy that designed all of those art works you see in my gallery. 

		So firstly I will fill you in on a bit about who I am and where I come from. Im from the counrty town of Warrnambool and grew up on a dairy farm. I am currently studying at Federation University in Ballarat undertaking a Bachelor of Communication Design. Yes I know its funny how a farmer can turn into a designer but I really enjoy coming up with unique and inventive ideas that are able to have an inpact amongst others. From a young age I was always creating things and that is what gave me a passion to study Graphic Design.

		You will notice that the way I design is simple, as the quote on my home page states simplicity and clarity are key. The more simple and clear a design is the more eye catching it is to viewers. The beauty of this is that in my designs I like to make it very clear what I am trying to communicate with my client, knowing who the company is and also what the company is about. I simplfy this as much as possible so when I design for a client it relates back to some part of the company but at the same time doesnâ€™t give much away. The more a viewer looks at a design the better it is done as they try and decode it looking for key parts in the logo that relate back to the company. They then see the bigger picture when they stand back, and watch the logo all come together to communicate what the logo and company is all about.</p>
